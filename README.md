User Story:

As a user, I want to quickly check the current weather and hourly forecast for any city, so I can make informed decisions about my daily plans and activities.

Steps:

1. Set up the HTML structure: Create a basic HTML file with input fields for the city name, a button to fetch weather data, and sections to display the current weather and hourly forecast.
2. Implement JavaScript functionality: Use the OpenWeatherMap API to get current weather and hourly forecast data based on the user's input.Display the fetched weather data and hourly forecast in the appropriate sections of the HTML.Handle potential errors gracefully and inform the user if something goes wrong (e.g., invalid city name or API request failure).
3. Style the application: Use CSS to ensure the application is visually appealing and fits within the desired layout.Incorporate Bootstrap for responsive design and to enhance the user interface with pre-built components and styles.
4.Test the application: Verify that the weather data is displayed correctly and updates dynamically when the user searches for different cities.Ensure the application is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
